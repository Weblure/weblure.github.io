After boarding, passengers find that everything isâ€¦just a little bit off.

After my travails trying to check out of the Hotel on Limbo, I was glad to find that the process of buying a train ticket to Heaven was smooth. Indeed, it went with almost pneumatic efficiency. So this is what excellent service is like, I thought as I sat down on a plush train seat. Perhaps it was a touch too soft, but I was eager to get as far from the hotel as possible and was forgiving of these small matters.\nThe train began to fill with other travelers, and the conductor announced over the speakers that we will be departing Limbo for Heaven shortly. Till then, there will be snacks and refreshments served in the dining car. I smiled beatifically at my fellow travelers and got up, eager to make my way over to indulge in the repast.\nAlas, joy soon fades. I had only taken a couple of steps before finding that there was already a large queue of passengers waiting to enter the dining car. I craned my head to see how long the wait was, but to my dismay, I saw that it seemed to extend for at least the length of one train car. I took a deep breath and reminded myself that we ought to be on our way soon and that really, it was quite understandable that the other passengers would want some food too. My good mood restored, I folded my hands and waited.\nBy the time I got to the dining car, the train was still stalled and I was ravenous. Unfortunately, all that remained of the snack buffet was a single graham cracker, along with two pieces of limp raspberries. When I tried to bolster my rapidly flagging spirits by searching for a drink, the only thing on offer was flat, lukewarm tonic water. The staff was already beginning to clean up. I glumly munched on the graham cracker and flagged down one of the waiters.\n\"Excuse me,\" I said. \"I was wondering if I could purchase a meal. You see, I'm dreadfully hungry and it seems that there's hardly any food left in the dining car's snack buffet.\"\nThe waiter looked at me with bovine placidity. \"My apologies, but","tags":["kafkaesque","train","uncanny","afterlife","dark comedy","first person"],"context":[{"text":"[ I am a dead soul on the Limbo Express, a train that promised to deliver souls from Limbo to Heaven.
